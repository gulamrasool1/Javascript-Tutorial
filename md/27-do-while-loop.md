# DO WHILE LOOP
[JS-FILE](../js/27-do-while-loop.js)

>THERE ARE SOME DIFFERNENCE BETWEEN WHILE LOOP AND DO WHILE LOOP I (WHILE LOOP ) WE USSE THIS RULE

```javascript
initialize
    |  
condition 
    |
increment / decrement
```

BUT IN (DO WHILE LOOP)WE USE THIS RULE

```javascript
initialize
    |  
increment / decrement
    |
condition
```

>i (do while loop ) we represent the rules like this first wwe use initialization then increment and decrent and then condition so the pattern is to do this loop

```javascript
var x = 1;
do {
    document.write( x +"this is do while loop");
    document.write("<br>");
    x++
}while(x <= 20)
```

## the end
