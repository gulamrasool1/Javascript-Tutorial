>in slice we can make a new arraw from another array we have some example like this

```javascript
var a = ["fayyaz","adnan","danis","arbaaz","mujahid"];
document.write(a + "<br>" + "<br>");
```

---

>this is a normal array but we are here to know about slice array so we take all example for this normal array

```javascript
var a = ["fayyaz","adnan","danis","arbaaz","mujahid"];
document.write(a + "<br>" + "<br>");
 var b = a.slice(1,4);
document.write(b+ "<br>" + "<br>");
```

>in this we talk about 1 prametere you learn that slice have two parameter (start , end ) but here we lerning for one parameter and its like this (start) this this will only start were form u want and end with last word becouse in this we only starting not ending

```javascript

# splice();
if we want to add some new value in existing array then we use splice method in this there are 3 condition to run this (index , how many delete , value ) in this first they ask that what index i will paste this and in second they ask you want to delete after pasting new value and in last they ask that which value i paste

```javascript
var a = ["fayyaz","adnan","danis","arbaaz","mujahid"];
document.write(a + "<br>" + "<br>");
a.splice(2,0,"ayyaz","sulman");
document.write(b);
```

>in this we saying that the value we named rajesh paste this in 1 number index and then we dont want to delete something then we write 0
