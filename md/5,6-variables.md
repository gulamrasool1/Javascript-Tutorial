[JS-FILE](../js/5,6-variable.js)

there are 3 type of variables

var
let
const
but now are tasting aboue variabl 1 in var we can give same condition at any time so the pattern is to write these

 ```javascript 
 var a = ("gulam rasul");
document.write(a);
document.write("<hr>");
var a = 10;
var b = 30;
var c = a+b
document.write(c);

````
so this is pattern to write var 1
