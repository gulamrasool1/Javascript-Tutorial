>we have one condition and we have to show noter one then use condition-terenary-operator this operator helps to find value of second condition


```javascript
structure => (condition)? true statement : false statement ;
we have 2 method to write this in practicle
1st method
var a = 15;
var b;
(a > 10) ? b = "true" : b="false";
document.write(b);
document.write("<br>");
2nd method
var a = 15;
var b;
(a > 50) ? b = "true" : b="false";
document.write(b);
```

>so this is how w have to work in condition tereranary operator
