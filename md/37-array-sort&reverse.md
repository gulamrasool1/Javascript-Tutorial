> what is sort and reverse array method ?

> first of all we talk about sort 
# SORT( );
> sort stands to make all array sequence vise like wite there first character i explain u ex -> you give a strig array like ("DANIS"),("ADNAN"),("FAYYAZ")to you know all alphabate A -> ADNAN B C D -> DANIS E F -> FAYYAZ GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 
ADNAN FIRST LATTER IS A SO ADANAN RUNS FIRST BUT WE GIVE ADNAN TO 3 BUT IF WE ADD SORT() METHOD THEN ADNAN COME 1ST SAME WITH FAYYAZ AND DANISH SO THE PATTERN TO USE THIS IN INTERNAL 

``` javascript 
var a = ["danis","adanan","fayyaz","arbaz","barkat"];
document.write(a + "<br>"+"<br>");
a.sort();
document.write(a);
if thir are two same charachter name then the name was sorted if thier ar two same charachter name then the name was sorted with thier number example -> adanan have 6 character and 
arbaz have only five so adanan is greter then arbaz so adanan show first
```

# REVERSE( );
>reverse stands ro givea reverse value ex -> if u give string or any kind of data type but in this i give string so we give this value ["danish","adanan","fayyaz","arbaz","barkat"] so if we use reverse method then the value show like that ["barkat","arbaz","fayyaz","adanan","danish"] so the pattern to use this in input is

```javascript
var a = ["danish","adnana","fayyaz","arbaz","barkat",];
a.reverse();
document.write(a);
```
