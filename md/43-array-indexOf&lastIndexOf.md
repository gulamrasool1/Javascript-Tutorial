# indexof();
> if we want to know about index of any value then we use indexof method i show u how it is 

```javascript
var a = ["adnan","danis","arbaaz","adnan","fayyaz","mujahid"];
document.write(a + "<br>" + "<br>")
var b = a.indexOf("adnan");
document.write(b);
```

>in this we have two parameter ("value" , start) this is showing that what is the index of your value and if u have to same value then the parameter counts first index first this is why we use start parameter too
