[JS-FIL](../js/30-even-and-odd-number-with-loops.js)

>in this  section we have to find even or odd files now i tell u how is  it we use (for loop + if statement) so the pattern is

``` java script 
for-loop(initilazation; condition; increment-or-decrement){
    var condition + % + == 0{
        document.write("");
    }
}
```

#### even numbers divided by 2 

```javascript
even numbers

for(var a = 1; a <= 20; a++){
  if(a % 2 == 0){
document.write( a+ "<br>");
  }
}
```
---

#### odd numbers not divided by 2

```javascript
odd numbers

for(var a = 1; a <=20; a++){
    if(a % 2 != 0){
        document.write(a+ "<br>");
    }
}
```
