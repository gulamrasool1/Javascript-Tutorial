>what is array ?

>Arryas is form data type every thing that we put iside of square bracket is array how array work so this is pattern 

```javascript

var a = [10,20,30,40,50];
document.write(a);
if we want to show 1, 1 itemes we put square bracket in document
document.writh(a[0]);
whtat is 0 ? in array we macth single -single things with table so table is start from 0 to word no
ex -> we put 10,20,30,40,50
in this 10 is 0;
20 is 1
30 is 2
40 is 3
50 is 4
so this is how we use the table

```
